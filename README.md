# Enclst
## What is this?
The Enclst is a notation rule for expressing a list consisting of **title strings** that can contain any character type ＊**without escaping** and their **attributes**. 

## Why not JSON?
JSON is a rich notation enough to represent general objects including lists. There is no difficulty for a computer program to handle a JSON. However it comes to humans, it is **NOT easy to write a no-error JSON string**. When you try to write JSON by hand, you may notice the following pitfalls:

- Prohibition of dangling commas
- String escaping

Even when experienced software engineers (like me :-) write a JSON by hand carefully, it's impossible to keep writing **without any errors**. Furthermore, asking **non-engineering end users** to input **error-free JSON** is unreasonable.

This is exactly my motivation for creating enclst. JSON is impossible for a non-engineer end user. A more succinct alternative must be necessary.

So, the [Enclst Notation](#enclst-notation) is designed to avoid both:

- The end of the item's **comma**.
- string **escaping**

The major pitfall of JSON has gone away.

# Enclst Notation
## The Structure of the Enclst.
An **Enclst** is a multi-line string separated by line breaks. The **first line** is interpreted as the **title string** for the entire enclst, followed by the **ItemList** separated by **a blank line** illustrated as follow:

![](draw.io/overallView/overallview.jpg)

In your application with our [libraries](#libraries), you can get an **Enclst** object from a string or text file following this Notation. 
The Enclst object has the following members:

- The **Title** string, is the same as the Title mentioned above.
- The **ItemList** array of **Item** object which is an object representation of the **Items** mentioned above.

## ItemList
The **ItemList** is a multi-line string that is the remainder of Enclst followed by The **Title** and a blank separator line, and each low is one **Item**. 

## Item
An Item is consist of **Value** and **Title** separated by the **first** vertical bar "**|**".

![](draw.io/Item/Item.jpg)

In your application with our [libraries](#libraries), The **Item** object has the following members:

- The **Title** string, is the same as the Title mentioned above.
- The **Value** object which is an object representation of the **Value** mentioned above.

## Value

The Value part consists of comma "**,**" separated string values.

![](draw.io/value/positionals/positionals.jpg)

Each value must not contain the following a couple of characters:
- commna "**,**"
- vertical line "**|**"

This limited restriction allows Enclst to be written in a very simple.

In your application with our [libraries](#libraries), you can refer to each value in two ways, by **positional** and by **name** as follow:

### Positional
These values can be referred to as **positional values** of a value of an item by a library like :

```
item.value.positional[0] // equal "value0"
```

### Named
A value containing an equal sign can refer to the right side using the left side as a name with a library as follows:

![](draw.io/value/named/named.jpg)

```
item.value.positional // equal ["value0", "val=kerokero", "attr=gerogero", "value"]
item.value.named["val"]  // equal "kerokero"
item.value.named["attr"] // equal "gerogero"
```

Note that a URL that includes parameters is interpreted as a named parameter, but it is not your expected. So refer to the named parameter only if you are intended, otherwise, refer to a positional parameter.

![](draw.io/value/unintended/unintended.jpg)

```
item.value.positional[0] // equal "https://iret.media/?s=HA+Proxy+%E7%99%" and it must be your intention.
item.value.named["https://iret.media/?s"] // equal "HA+Proxy+%E7%99%" but it must be not your intention.
```
## Separator
The **first** vertical line "**|**" in the Item string is recognized as the **separator** which separates **Value** and **Title**.

Because of this, each value string can't include the vertical bar "**|**".
In fact, many of the specifications for meaningful strings, such as **URL** strings, explicitly **prohibit** them from containing bar "**|**", and many meaningful ID strings are also not intended to contain vertical bars. Therefore, I believe that there are few situations where this restriction will cause trouble.

On the other hand, **title strings** essentially use **arbitrary characters** and **vertical bars are often used as well**.
Other common notations, such as JSON, require tedious escaping to include vertical bars in strings.

However, thanks to the aforementioned limitations, **Enclst** notation allows vertical bars **without troublesome escaping** to be used inside title strings.

## Title
The Title is the **second half** of the item string separated by the first vertical bar "**|**".
This string can be used as an explanation, a headline, etc. of values.

As mentioned in the section **Separator**, the title string is designed for any **escaping is not needed**. Even commas "**,**" and vertical lines "**|**", you can use them **without escaping**.
This is exactly the benefit of using value limits.

# Structured List
A hierarchical list is expressed as a link of the Enclist.

![](draw.io/structure/structure.jpg)

Following features are available in our [libraries](#libraries):

- Function to guess if a value is for the enclst file or not.
- Function to create child enclist indicated by the value for the enclist file mentioned above.

# How concise the Enclst is

A following JSON expressing a list of youtube contents; 
```
{
  "title": "Antonio Pappano",
  "items": [
    { "text": "Wagner: \"Das Rheingold\" - Pappano, K. Warner, London 2005 Part 1", "content": "cwpxogKjDH0"},
    { "text": "Wagner: \"Das Rheingold\" - Pappano, K. Warner, London 2005 Part 2", "content": "7yIDvqY8VTE"},
    { "text": "\"Die Walküre\" - Proms 2005 - Antonio Pappano", "content": "Vq-2PVXfOv4"},
    { "text": "Wagner - \"Parsifal\" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 1", "content": "FChG1jb_Y&t"},
    { "text": "Wagner - \"Parsifal\" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 2", "content": "W048GbyGKPs"},
    { "text": "Wagner - \"Parsifal\" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 3", "content": "GkN9KfpIKA8"}
  ]
}
```

can be written in Enclst as follows:

```
Antonio Pappano

cwpxogKjDH0 | Wagner: "Das Rheingold" - Pappano, K. Warner, London 2005 Part 1
7yIDvqY8VTE | Wagner: "Das Rheingold" - Pappano, K. Warner, London 2005 Part 2
Vq-2PVXfOv4 | "Die Walküre" - Proms 2005 - Antonio Pappano
FChG1jb_Y&t | Wagner - "Parsifal" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 1
W048GbyGKPs | Wagner - "Parsifal" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 2
GkN9KfpIKA8 | Wagner - "Parsifal" (Antonio Pappano) ACT 3
```

No more redundant **parentheses**, **quotes**, **escape sequences**, and **commas**, much more succinct. Even non-engineers can handwrite it in this notation rule.
